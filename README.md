# Final Project - Falling words typing game

In my project, I created a game that practice your typing skills that has three difficulty level: Easy, medium and extreme.

# how to play

Choose a difficulty level and click on the start game button to start.

Once you click to start, words will start to appear on the browser and they will start to fall down.

Your task is to type words appearing on the screen before they have fallen down!

If your input is same as the word on the screen, it will disappear and you will get your score!

Try to type as much as you can within 60 seconds. 

At the end of the game, you will be able to see your Words typing speed!
